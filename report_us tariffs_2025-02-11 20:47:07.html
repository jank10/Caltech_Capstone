    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>As of February 2025, the Trump administration has intensified its protectionist trade policies, imposing significant tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China. These measures include a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports and additional tariffs on various goods from these countries. The tariffs aim to bolster the US economy by protecting domestic industries but have led to heightened tensions and potential retaliatory actions from affected nations. Notably, Canada and Mexico have negotiated temporary postponements of some tariffs while discussions continue. The current situation reflects a complex landscape of trade negotiations and economic implications, with potential for further developments.</p>
